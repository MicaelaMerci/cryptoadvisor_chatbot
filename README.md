## Cryptoadvisor Bot

# How it works

This chatbot mimics basic AI decision-making by using rule-based logic to analyze user input and match it with predefined cryptocurrency data. It responds with advice based on trends and sustainability scores. Though it doesn't learn like advanced AI, it simulates intelligent behavior through logical conditions and structured responses.
